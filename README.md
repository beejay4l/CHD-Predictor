This code is for the development of the coronary heart disease prognostic system. A system that can efficiently classify coronary heart disease into four different severity stages. The classification are as follows:
0: Normal means the individual is normal
1: SIHD means the individual is suffering from Stable Ischemic Heart Disease
2: Unstable Angina
3: NSTEMI means the individual is suffering from Non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction
4: STEMI means the individual is suffering from ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction
